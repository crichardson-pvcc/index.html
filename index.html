        <h1>My rant IS in a text box that text box i just made clear yes i wasted all my time - 8 minutes making it clear</h1>
        <p>The idea of governments and big corporations snooping around your online activities is a whole mess of problems that people don’t even seem to understand, or they just ignore it because they don’t think it’ll affect them. But the truth is, being watched all the time is like having someone peeking over your shoulder 24/7, and it messes with your head. You start questioning every little thing you do, and before you know it, you’re second-guessing yourself all the time, filtering out anything that could get you into trouble. </p>

        <p>It’s like you’re walking around with a bunch of invisible strings tied to you, pulling you back every time you try to go off script. And what’s worse is that you don’t even know who’s pulling those strings. Is it a government? A corporation? Or is it just some algorithm, watching your every move to predict what you might do next?</p>

        <p>When you’re aware of being watched, you change. You start pretending to be someone you’re not. You might stop saying what you really think or look up certain things because you’re scared someone’s gonna take that information and twist it against you. It’s like trying to live in a glass box, where everything you do is seen by some stranger somewhere. You stop talking about things that matter or things that could actually make a difference. </p>

        <p>The more you think about it, the more you start doubting your own thoughts. The paranoia builds up, and the next thing you know, you’re just like everyone else — quiet and scared to say anything that might seem “wrong” or “suspicious.” It’s not just that you’re being watched; it’s how it makes you act, how it turns you into someone less free, less yourself.</p>

        <p>But this isn’t just about you. When everyone’s being watched all the time, society as a whole starts to get messed up too. People start becoming more cautious. No one wants to step out of line, because, who knows, maybe someone’s tracking them. And that’s how societies start to lose their freedom. People stop thinking for themselves and start doing what’s “safe,” what’s “normal,” because that’s what’s going to keep them out of trouble. </p>

        <p>It becomes a society of sheep, just following the rules because the fear of being watched is too much. That’s not the kind of world anyone should want to live in, but that’s the direction we’re heading in if we keep letting governments and corporations control everything we do online.</p>

        <p>And don’t even get me started on how these entities use the data they collect. The truth is, they don’t know you. They don’t know your intentions or your real self. They just know numbers, and numbers can be twisted. That’s why the data they collect is so dangerous. It’s not just information; it’s a distortion of who you are. Someone out there is making decisions about you based on a few lines of code, and if that data is wrong, or if they interpret it wrong, it could be used to label you, to judge you, to make you a target. </p>

        <p>It’s like they’re trying to build a profile of you, but all they’re getting is a mess of assumptions and guesses. And the worst part? You can’t do anything about it. You’re trapped in a system where your privacy isn’t even an option.</p>

        <p>Let’s talk about how power plays into all of this. Governments and corporations have the ability to control what we see, what we think, and even how we live. They hold all the cards when it comes to data, and we’re just stuck here trying to make sense of it all. They collect data like it’s no big deal, but they’re using it to track us, predict our next move, and manipulate us into doing what they want. We’re the ones who suffer from it, but they don’t care. </p>

        <p>They’ll say it’s for safety, for security, but at what cost? The power imbalance here is staggering. They take your data, they invade your privacy, and they don’t even need your consent to do it. You’re left with nothing but a sense of helplessness, watching as the people who control everything use your own information against you.</p>

        <p>And let’s not forget about the fact that this isn’t even an exact science. The people analyzing your data? They don’t know you. They don’t know who you are or why you do what you do. They just look at numbers and patterns and make assumptions. But what happens when those assumptions are wrong? What happens when you get mislabeled, misunderstood, or even punished for something you didn’t do? That’s the danger of this system. It’s not just about collecting data; it’s about how that data is misinterpreted and misused.</p>

        <p>Sure, there are groups like the EFF, Qwant, and Privacy International that try to stand up for digital rights and privacy. But honestly, what are they really doing? They write articles. They advocate. But at the end of the day, they’re just throwing words into the void, hoping someone listens. And maybe, just maybe, they’ll make a difference. But how much of a difference can they make when the system they’re fighting against is so massive and entrenched? The fight for privacy feels like a losing battle, one that’s been reduced to arguments on paper with little to no action behind them. All they do is write articles.</p>
